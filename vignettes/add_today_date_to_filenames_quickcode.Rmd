## fAddDate function

#### In R, data often gets saved to files for future use or subsequent processes. However, without a version control system in place, ensuring the consistency and reproducibility of saved data can pose challenges, particularly when scripts evolve over time. The "fAddDate" function addresses such concerns by automatically appending the current date to the file name, mitigating the risk of data loss and enhancing reproducibility. By simplifying the process with just a single line of code, users no longer need to manually update the date of each run, thereby streamlining workflow efficiency. Reproducibility in programming is crucial for maintaining the integrity of analyses and fostering trust in research outcomes. Ensuring that results can be consistently replicated not only enhances transparency but also facilitates collaboration and builds confidence in the reliability of findings. Therefore, by incorporating automated date stamping, this function not only safeguards against data inconsistency but also reinforces the fundamental principles of reproducible research in R programming.

## Usage

Let's load the USArrests data. And let's assume that we want to save data to the system using the content of the row names as our file names.

```{r}
data("USArrests")

filenames = paste0(row.names(USArrests), ".txt")

head(filenames,8) # before adding today's date

rev.filenames = fAddDate(filenames) # append today's date to the file names

rev.filenames

#...write further codes to use the file names to save new files.

```
