\title{Check Multicollinearity Between Two Covariate Vectors}
\usage{
check_collinear(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the first covariate (e.g., AGE).}

\item{y}{A numeric vector representing the second covariate (e.g., WEIGHT).}
}
\value{
A list containing the VIF value and a message about the level of multicollinearity.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to assess multicollinearity
between two covariate vectors. A VIF value greater than 10 indicates high multicollinearity.
}
\examples{
# Example 1
age <- c(25, 30, 35, 40, 45)
weight <- c(60, 70, 80, 90, 100)
check_collinear(age, weight)

# Example 2
age2 <- c(20, 22, 24, 26, 28)
weight2 <- c(50, 55, 53, 58, 60)
check_collinear(age2, weight2)

# Example 3
age3 <- c(30, 35, 40, 45, 50)
weight3 <- c(70, 75, 80, 85, 90)
check_collinear(age3, weight3)

# Example 4
age4 <- c(60, 62, 65, 67, 70)
weight4 <- c(80, 82, 85, 90, 95)
check_collinear(age4, weight4)

# Example 5
age5 <- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
weight5 <- c(30, 35, 40, 45, 50)
check_collinear(age5, weight5)
