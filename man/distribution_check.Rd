\usage{

is.normal(values, sig = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{values}{vector of values}

\item{sig}{significance level to test p-value against}
}
\value{
boolean value if lognormal distributed

boolean value if normal distributed
}
\description{
Check whether a vector of data contains values that fit a lognormal or normal distribution
}
\details{
This function takes a numeric vector as its input. This vector contains the dataset that will be analyzed.
\cr
This function first performs a Shapiro-Wilk test on the data to check if it comes from a normal distribution. The Shapiro-Wilk test checks if sample data came from a normal distribution. It returns a p-value, with a higher p-value indicating stronger evidence that the data is normally distributed.
\cr
If the p-value from the Shapiro-Wilk test is above a predefined threshold (such as 0.05), the data is considered normally distributed. In this case, the function returns "normal".
\cr
If the data fails the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, the function then checks if the data fits a lognormal distribution. It transforms the data by taking the natural logarithm of each value. It then runs the Shapiro-Wilk test on the transformed data.
\cr
If the p-value from this test on the logged data is above the threshold, the function returns "lognormal", indicating the untransformed data fits a lognormal distribution after logging.
\cr
If the data fails both the normal and logged Shapiro-Wilk tests, the function returns "neither", indicating the data does not appear to come from a normal or lognormal distribution based on the tests.
