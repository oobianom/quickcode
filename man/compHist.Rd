}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{NUMERIC. the first distribution}

\item{x2}{NUMERIC. the second distribution}

\item{title}{CHARACTER. title of the histogram plot}

\item{col1}{CHARACTER. color fill for first distribution}

\item{col2}{CHARACTER. color fill for second distribution}

\item{xlab}{CHARACTER. label of the x-axis}

\item{ylab}{CHARACTER. label of the y-axis}

\item{separate}{LOGICAL. whether to separate the plots}
}
\value{
return histogram comparison using basic histogram plot
}
\description{
For comparing histograms of two data distributions.
Simply input the two distributions, and it generates a clear and
informative histogram that illustrates the differences between the data.
}
\details{
Users have the option to view individual histograms for each distribution
before initiating the comparison, allowing for a detailed examination of
each dataset's characteristics. This feature ensures a comprehensive
understanding of the data and enhances the user's ability to interpret
the results of the distribution comparison provided by this function.

\examples{
# compare two normal distributions with means that differ a lot
# in this case, the overlap will not be observed

  x2 = rnorm(1000, mean = 10),
  title = "Histogram of Distributions With Means 3 & 10",
  col1 = "yellow", col2 = "violet"
