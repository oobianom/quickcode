\title{Calculate the distance of points from the center of a cluster}
\usage{
pairDist(data, round)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame object or a matrix/array object}

\item{round}{round result to decimal place}
}
\value{
a named vector consisting of a row number and a pair-distance value
}
\description{
This function operates on multivariate data and
calculates the distance of points from the centroid of one or more clusters.
}
\section{Function utility}{

Used to generate the computations needed to model pair-distance measures in three dimensions
}

\section{More information about this function}{

The pairDist function is used to quantify how far each data point (row)
is from the overall mean across all columns. Itâ€™s commonly used in multivariate statistics,
machine learning, and data analysis to assess the variability or similarity of data points
relative to their mean. More specifically, the function is used in outlier detection and
cluster analysis to evaluate the dispersion of data. Used in conjunction with other
calculations, pairDist output can also be used to model data in three dimensions.

\examples{

data = attenu[,1:2]

# example 1: basic example using data.frame
pairDist(data)

# example 2: basic example using as.matrix
pairDist(as.matrix(data))

# example 3: round results to 2 decimal points
pairDist(data, 2)

# example 4
data = matrix(
c(1, 5, NA, 4, 5, 6, NA, 8, 9, NA, 12, 23, 6, 0, 3, 3, 8, 15),
ncol = 3,
byrow = TRUE)
x = pairDist(data, 3)
data = data.frame(data)
data = cbind(data, x)
