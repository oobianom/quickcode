\title{Increment a number till a length is reached}
\usage{
seq3(start, increment, count = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{start}{starting count}

\item{increment}{number to increment by}

\item{count}{length of output}
}
\value{
numbers dictated by increment number
}
\description{
Designed to increment a number by a specified value
until a predefined count is reached.
}
\details{
Users can easily leverage this function to automate the incrementation process,
making it a convenient solution for repetitive tasks. It is just a surrogate to the
seq() function, more useful depending on the goal of the user.
}
\examples{
# task 1: starting with 2, increment by 10 until 5 numbers are obtained
seq3(2,10,count=5)

# task 2: starting with 4, increment by 4 until 4 numbers are archieved
# this is similar (but simpler) to obtaining 4 multiples of 4
# this may also be achieved with seq function like
# seq(4,16,4) or seq(4,16,length.out=4)
seq3(4,4,4)

# other examples
seq3(1,6) #add 6 until 10 numbers are generated
seq3(1,2,7) # add 2 until 7 numbers are generated
seq3(133,7,6)# add 7 until 6 numbers are generated
seq3(1111,40,100)# add 40 until 100 numbers are generated
